# âš¡ Quick Start

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** A quick start guide can be good to help folks get up and running with your API in a few steps. Some people prefer diving in with the basics rather than meticulously reading every page of documentation!

## Install dependencies

To get started, grab all the dependencies:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** It is generally a good practice to create a python virtual environment per project and install dependencies in the activated environment. For more information about virtual environments: [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
